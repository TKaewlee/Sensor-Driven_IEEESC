# Sensor-Driven_IEEESC

# This is Execution plan for Sensor-Driven Achieving of Smart Living Research: A Review

## Objectives (What is reader looking for?) ==> (what's showed in the table)
### 1. What kinds of sensors we reveiw ==> Sensor
    devided by tasks 
    : affective computing, activity tracker, sleep monitoring and food and nutrition

    Each tasks devided by types of sensor 
    : Biomedical Sensor, Kinematic Sensor, Kinetic Sensor, Radar-based Sensor, Other Sensor

### 2. Which data that sensor can measure? ==> Objectives | features
    affective computing
    : Emotion [{Classification of discrete emotion}, {Regression by levels}]

    activity tracker
    : cardiac activity, Motion, Force & Pressure [{Classification of discrete activities}, {Gait analysis?}, {HR accuracy?}]

    sleep monitoring
    : Sleep stages & disorders [{Classification of discrete sleep stages}, {Classification of discrete disorders}]

    food and nutrition
    : Food intake [{Weight?}]

### 3. Which algorithm/method for get the data and performance? ==> Algorithm | Performance
    detailed in each sensor in each task // read from the table

### 4. Availble Datasets
### 5. Discussion


## Common in Each tasks

### \subsection{Topic of Tasks} : affective computing, activity tracker, sleep monitoring, food and nutrition
    - What's & WHY we need this data
    - What the main target data = objective [classification, regresstion]
    - How to set the experiments 

### \subsubsection{Sensor Types} : Biomedical Sensor, Kinematic Sensor, Kinetic Sensor, Radar-based Sensor, Other Sensor
    - What is the sensor and data that we can get
    - The algorithm to get the data 
    - pro & con
