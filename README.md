# Sensor-Driven_IEEESC

## This is Execution plan for Sensor-Driven Achieving of Smart Living Research: A Review

### Objectives (What is reader looking for?) 
#### - What kinds of sensors we reveiw 
    >> devided by tasks 
    >> : affective computing, activity tracker, sleep monitoring and food and nutrition

    >> Each tasks devided by types of sensor 
    >> : Biomedical Sensor, Kinematic Sensor, Kinetic Sensor, Radar-based Sensor, Other Sensor

#### - Which data that sensor can measure? 
    >> affective computing
    >> : Emotion [{Classification of discrete emotion}, {Regression by levels}]
    >> activity tracker
    >> : HR, Motion, Force & Pressure
    >> sleep monitoring
    >> : Sleep stages & disorders
    >> food and nutrition
